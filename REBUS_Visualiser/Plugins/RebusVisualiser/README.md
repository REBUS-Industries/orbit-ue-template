# RebusVisualiser (UE 5.7 plugin)

The Unreal-engine side of the REBUS/ORBIT **PRISM Visualiser**, implemented against the
portal's live contracts as described in `ue-plugin-build-guide.md`. It consumes the
`/api/ue/*` REST contract and the bidirectional Pixel Streaming 2 data-channel descriptors,
drives moving-head fixtures with Speckle/Orbit viewer **motion parity**, and reports state
back to the portal.

This plugin is **self-sufficient**: it fetches the scene, builds fixture geometry proxies
from `/meshes`, places + drives the lights, and talks the data channel — it does not require
`OrbitConnector` to be present (in a packaged PRISM build, OrbitConnector still imports the
full ORBIT geometry; this plugin owns the *fixture* lifecycle and control regardless).

## Where it lives in the project

`REBUS_Visualiser/Plugins/RebusVisualiser/` and is enabled in `REBUS_Visualiser.uproject`.
Build the `REBUS_VisualiserEditor` (or `REBUS_Visualiser` Game) target as usual — it compiles
in-context with the project's other plugins.

## Identity (no id translation)

The **Speckle node id** (`/scene → fixtures[].id`) is the single control key. Spawned actors
are registered under it (`RegisterFixture(NodeId, Actor)`), and it is exactly what every
inbound descriptor and outbound `FixtureRegistered`/`FixtureState` carries. The **library id**
(`fixtures[].fixtureId`) is used only to fetch the profile (`/api/ue/fixtures/{libraryId}`).

## Base level

The project runs from `/Game/REBUS/Maps/BaseLevel` (wired in `Config/DefaultEngine.ini`).
It's a blank level whose default, portal-controllable environment is an **ExponentialHeightFog**
(volumetric, full extent) + an **unbound PostProcessVolume** + sun/sky. Generate the `.umap`
once with `Content/Python/build_rebus_base_level.py` (Tools > Execute Python Script, or headless
`-run=pythonscript`). As a safety net, the session subsystem also find-or-spawns the fog +
post-process volume at launch (`EnsureSceneEnvironment`), so the stream renders even on a level
that was authored without them. The fog (`FogDensity`, `bVolumetricFog`, ...) and studio lights
are then driven from the portal via `SetSceneProperty` (§9).

## Configuration

`PortalUrl` + `x-api-key` come from the launch command line (preferred for the secret) or
`[RebusVisualiser]` in `DefaultGame.ini`:

```
-PortalUrl="https://app.rebus.industries" -RebusApiKey=<plugin key>
```

PRISM launch tokens consumed (§10.2):
`-PixelStreamingID=orbit_<shortRunId>` (the streamer is registered/looked up under this id —
never hardcoded), `-OrbitProject` (portal doc id), `-OrbitModel`, `-OrbitVersion`,
`-OrbitServer`, `-OrbitTarget`.

> Quote the URL in `.ini` — UE strips `//` from unquoted values (§4.0).

## Lifecycle

1. Subsystem reads config + tokens, configures the REST client, creates the data channel.
2. Once a game world is live and config is usable: `GET /api/ue/scene`, pre-fetch each unique
   profile + `/meshes`, then spawn one `ARebusFixtureActor` per fixture at its placement and
   register it.
3. The data channel binds to the PS2 streamer and registers the `UIInteraction` handler.
4. When the channel is open, the scene is loaded, **and** the scene environment has been
   ensured, emit `Ready` (with `loadedModel` counts + capability flags), one `FixtureRegistered`
   per fixture, and re-apply the live selection. The portal then sends `RequestSceneState` → we
   answer `SceneState`.
5. Periodic `FrameStats` while live.

> **First-load state sync (no recycle needed).** `Ready` is gated on the scene environment being
> ensured (`bEnvEnsured`) so the portal only starts pushing `SetSceneProperty`/`LoadScene` after
> the fog/post-process/floor/sun/sky actors those pushes target actually exist — early pushes can
> no longer hit missing actors and get dropped. The scene-settings subsystem keeps an
> authoritative map of every applied value and **re-applies all of them** (`ReapplyAll`) whenever
> the environment is ensured or fixtures (re)spawn, so portal state (and seeded defaults) sticks
> on the first connection instead of only after a recycle. The ordering is verifiable in the log:
> `Scene environment ensured.` → `Re-applied N scene property value(s)...` → `Handshake: Ready
> (channel open, scene loaded, environment ensured) -> broadcasting.`

## Scene push over the data channel (REST-free fixtures)

When the portal cannot serve `/api/ue/scene` to the running instance (e.g. the instance has no
route to the portal API, or the REST call 404s), the **portal can push the same data over the
already-open Pixel Streaming data channel** instead. The plugin parses the identical payload
shapes the REST endpoints return and spawns/drives fixtures exactly as if they had been fetched.

Send these as normal `UIInteraction` descriptors (same envelope as `SetFixturePanTilt`/`Ping`):

```jsonc
// One-shot push (preferred when the whole scene fits in one data-channel message):
{
  "type": "LoadScene",
  "scene":    { /* identical body to GET /api/ue/scene */ },
  "profiles": { "<libraryFixtureId>": { /* identical body to GET /api/ue/fixtures/{id} */ } },  // optional
  "meshes":   { "<libraryFixtureId>": { /* identical body to GET /api/ue/fixtures/{id}/meshes */ } } // optional
}

// Incremental (for larger scenes, to stay under the per-message size limit):
{ "type": "RegisterFixtureProfile", "libraryId": "<id>", "profile": { ... }, "meshes": { ... } } // repeat per profile
{ "type": "LoadScene", "scene": { ... } }   // spawns using whatever profiles were cached above

```

Behaviour:
- `LoadScene` clears any previously spawned fixtures, spawns one `ARebusFixtureActor` per
  `scene.fixtures[]` at its `matrixZUpMeters` placement, registers it under the **Speckle node
  id** (`fixtures[].id`) — the same key `SetFixture*` uses — and re-broadcasts `Ready` +
  `FixtureRegistered`.
- `profiles`/`meshes` are optional. Without a profile a fixture is **light-only**: it has no
  custom geometry and no GDTF motion rig, so it falls back to a **default moving-head beam**
  that rests pointing straight down and pans/tilts the spotlight from the inbound `pan`/`tilt`.
  For full parity — the physical head/yoke geometry moving with exact pivots, axes and limits —
  include the `profile` (with `motionRig` + `parts`/`<Beam>`); the GDTF solver then takes over.
- Profiles can be sent inline in `LoadScene` or ahead of time via `RegisterFixtureProfile`.
- `RegisterFixtureMeshes` delivers a fixture's meshes **additively and chunk-by-chunk** when one
  fixture's full bundle is too large for a single message. Each message carries a *subset* of
  `meshes[]`; the plugin **merges** the chunks per `libraryId` (appending, not overwriting) and,
  once `chunkCount` messages have arrived (or `chunkCount <= 1` for a single message), commits the
  merged bundle to the mesh cache — replacing any prior partial. Chunks are counted, not indexed,
  so out-of-order/duplicate `chunkIndex` values are tolerated. On completion, if fixtures are
  already spawned, the affected scene is re-spawned (re-broadcasting the handshake) so light-only
  fixtures of that `libraryId` gain their geometry; otherwise a later `LoadScene` uses the now-
  cached meshes.
- `RegisterFixtureIes` delivers the fixture's **photometrics as raw IESNA LM-63 file text**
  inline (no URL fetch), keyed per `libraryId`. It has **two independent accumulation levels**:
  - **Message-level** (`chunkIndex`/`chunkCount`): `profiles[]` are appended per `libraryId`,
    order-independent (same model as `RegisterFixtureMeshes`), and finalized once `chunkCount`
    messages have arrived (or `chunkCount <= 1` for a single message).
  - **Per-profile fragmentation** (`part`/`partCount`): the accumulated entries are grouped by
    `profileId`; when any entry for a `profileId` has `partCount > 1`, its entries are sorted by
    `part` and their `iesText` is **concatenated** to rebuild the full file. Otherwise the lone
    entry's `iesText` is the whole file.
  - On finalize the plugin builds one `UTextureLightProfile` per `(libraryId, profileId)` from
    the reassembled text and **indexes by `zoomDmx`** (the default profile = `profileId
    == "default"`, else the entry nearest mid-zoom). `iesText` is fed verbatim to the **same**
    `RebusIes::BuildLightProfile` (engine `FIESConverter`) the URL fetch uses — no base64, no
    second parser. If fixtures are already spawned, the affected scene is re-applied so the
    fixtures gain their true IES immediately.
- **IES precedence** (`SelectIesForZoom`): an inline `iesText` profile for the requested zoom
  **wins**; if a needed profile isn't inline, the signed `iesUrl`/`iesProfileUrl` is fetched
  (existing REST path); if neither exists, the **synthetic cone** is kept. The inline push never
  regresses the URL path.
- `RegisterFixtureGobos` delivers gobo wheel images **inline as base64** (no URL fetch), keyed
  per `libraryId`. Same **two accumulation levels** as `RegisterFixtureIes`:
  - **Message-level** (`chunkIndex`/`chunkCount`): `gobos[]` are appended per `libraryId`,
    order-independent, finalized once `chunkCount` messages have arrived.
  - **Per-image fragmentation** (`part`/`partCount`): the accumulated entries are grouped by
    `(wheelIndex, slot)`; when any entry has `partCount > 1`, its entries are sorted by `part` and
    their `dataBase64` is **concatenated BEFORE a single `FBase64::Decode`** (so a base64 blob
    split mid-string reassembles correctly). Otherwise the lone entry's `dataBase64` is decoded.
    (Legacy entries without a `wheelIndex` fall back to grouping by wheel **name**.)
  - On finalize the plugin caches the decoded bytes per **`(libraryId, wheelIndex, slot)`** (the
    contract's primary key; `wheel` name is retained as secondary metadata). The `UTexture2D` is
    built lazily on selection via `FImageUtils::ImportBufferAsTexture2D` (engine image utils,
    auto-detects png/jpeg — no `ImageWrapper` dependency) and fed into the **same** light-function
    MID path the URL gobo fetch uses (texture swap only — no new render path). If the fixture is
    already spawned, the currently-selected gobo is re-applied so it appears without a reselect.
- **Gobo selection correlation** (`SetFixtureGobo(goboIndex, wheelIndex?)`): `goboIndex` (0-based)
  is the **slot**; `wheelIndex` is **0-based into the full `wheels[]`** (NOT just gobo-kind wheels).
  The cache is keyed by **`(wheelIndex, slot)`**, so selection is a direct lookup:
  1. With an explicit **`wheelIndex`**, the texture for `(wheelIndex, slot == goboIndex)` is used
     directly — a colour/effect wheel preceding the gobo wheel can no longer mis-resolve it.
  2. When **`wheelIndex` is absent**, fall back to the **first gobo-kind wheel** = the *smallest*
     `wheelIndex` among inline entries tagged `wheelKind/kind/type == "gobo"` (then the smallest
     `wheelIndex` of any entry). A legacy `wheel` **name** hint is still honoured as a secondary
     match for pushes that carry no `wheelIndex`.
  3. A null/empty/out-of-range `goboIndex` clears the gobo.

  Wheel resolution is centralized in `ARebusFixtureActor::ResolveGoboWheelIndex` (the one spot to
  tweak if the portal's delta differs).
- **Gobo precedence** (`AssignGobo`): an inline base64 image for the selected `(wheel, slot)`
  **wins**; else its (or the profile wheel's) signed `imageUrl` is fetched; else nothing.
- Gobo/IES URLs (when no inline data is present) are still fetched lazily; if the portal is
  unreachable they simply don't load, but dimmer/colour/pan-tilt/zoom still work. Treat each URL
  value as **opaque**: over the data channel the portal sends **absolute signed GCS URLs** (GET
  directly, no `x-api-key`, no redirect), while over REST they are relative **307 redirects**
  fetched with `x-api-key`.

This is purely additive: the REST path (§Lifecycle 2) still runs, and a `LoadScene` push
overrides it.

## Rendering: MegaLights + volumetric fog (§5.7)

The visualiser renders concert/beam-heavy moving heads with **MegaLights** (stochastic local
lighting) plus a **volumetric height fog** so beams read through haze. The baseline is enabled
at startup and re-tunable at runtime per quality tier.

### Baseline CVars (startup)

`Config/DefaultEngine.ini` `[SystemSettings]` sets the stable baseline (read at startup; applies
in `-game` / packaged):

```
r.MegaLights.Allow=1
r.MegaLights.NumSamplesPerPixel=4
r.MegaLights.DownsampleMode=1
r.MegaLights.Volume=1
r.MegaLights.Volume.GridPixelSize=2
r.MegaLights.Volume.GridSizeZ=128
r.VolumetricFog.HistoryWeight=0.9
r.VolumetricFog.GridPixelSize=2
r.VolumetricFog.GridSizeZ=128
```

`r.MegaLights.Allow=1`, `r.MegaLights.DownsampleMode=1`, and `r.MegaLights.Volume=1` are
**baselined** (the same for every tier — the runtime tiers always re-assert `Allow`/`Volume`).

The engine **VolumetricFog froxel-grid** CVars (`r.VolumetricFog.*`) are **fixed defaults** and
are **NOT** controlled by the `RenderQuality` tiers — they stay put regardless of tier:

| CVar | Default | Engine default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `r.VolumetricFog.HistoryWeight` | `0.9` | 0.9 |
| `r.VolumetricFog.GridPixelSize` | `2` | 16 |
| `r.VolumetricFog.GridSizeZ` | `128` | 64 |

> Note: the engine `r.VolumetricFog.*` froxel grid is **separate** from the MegaLights lighting
> volume grid (`r.MegaLights.Volume.*`). Only the latter is tier-controlled.

> **Beam smoothness (v1.0.37).** The beam material `M_RebusBeam` has **no noise term** — its
> raymarch density is a smooth analytic radial-core × length-falloff profile. The "patchy" beam was
> the **coarse froxel grid** of the hero-shadow fog (`VolumetricScatteringIntensity` re-enabled on
> hero beams). Fixed by halving the froxel footprint (`r.VolumetricFog.GridPixelSize` 4 → **2**),
> raising temporal accumulation (`r.VolumetricFog.HistoryWeight` 0.75 → **0.9**), and lowering
> `RebusHeroShadowScatter` (1.5 → **0.8**) so the smooth mesh-cone raymarch dominates while the fog
> still carves the truss shadow gaps. To tune live without a rebuild: `r.VolumetricFog.GridPixelSize`
> (lower = finer/heavier), `r.VolumetricFog.HistoryWeight` (higher = smoother, slight latency).

> **Beam stays visible up close / inside the cone (v1.0.39).** The mesh-cone beam (`BeamCone`, a
> `UProceduralMeshComponent` + the additive two-sided `M_RebusBeam`) vanished when the camera moved
> **close to or inside** the cone (the lit floor pool stayed; only the volumetric shaft dropped out,
> on all beams). This was **not** culling — it was a mesh-bounded raymarch **entry** bug. The old
> Custom HLSL started the march at the rasterized fragment (`tFront`) and marched **forward
> downrange**; when the camera is inside, the only fragment is the far wall (a back face, drawn
> because the material is two-sided), and marching forward from it leaves the cone so every sample
> missed. Fixed by reworking the march interval analytically from the **view ray vs the cone**
> (re-baked `M_RebusBeam`, `0 error(s)`):
> - **ENTRY** = the camera itself when the camera is inside the cone (so the march always starts at
>   `t=0`), otherwise the analytic near (front-wall) intersection so distant beams stay tightly
>   sampled.
> - **EXIT** = this fragment's own surface distance, clamped by the opaque **scene depth** (occlusion
>   preserved). Because EXIT is the fragment's own depth, a front-face fragment marches a ~zero
>   interval and the far/back-face fragment carries the shaft — so two-sided drawing never
>   double-adds, with no per-face branching.
> - A short **near-camera soft fade** (last ~10 cm) avoids a hard wall in the lens when flying
>   through; it no longer blanks the whole beam.
>
> The v1.0.38 bounds work is kept but reduced to a **modest 1.5×** margin (`RebusBeamBoundsScale`,
> extent-only) since bounds were never the cause. Still to watch: looking straight **down the open
> axis** of the cone (toward the far opening) has no lateral back face along that ray, so the shaft
> can thin to nothing there — an acceptable edge case (the beam is a small bright dot from that view).

> **Beam brightness & source-to-tip falloff (v1.0.40).** The shaft was faint and *faded out near the
> fixture* — the opposite of a real light beam. Cause: the raymarch density had no width
> normalization, so a view ray crosses a **short** path through the narrow near-lens region (faint)
> and a **long** path through the wide far end (brighter), peaking mid-beam; and the old `lenA`
> length term pushed the far end toward zero. Reworked the per-sample density in `M_RebusBeam`
> (re-baked, `0 error(s)`):
> - **Width-bias normalization** — density scales as `REF_RADIUS_CM / radiusAt`, cancelling the
>   chord-length growth so the on-axis shaft reads **uniform along its length** before falloff
>   (near-lens no longer faint).
> - **Distance-from-source falloff** — a softened inverse square `1 / (1 + BeamFalloff·(axial/Length)²)`
>   makes the beam **brightest at the lens** and dim smoothly downrange (matches the inverse-square
>   intuition). `BeamFalloff` is now this falloff **strength** (0 = flat, higher = faster dimming),
>   not the old length-fade exponent.
> - **Lens-diameter start** — the cone base radius (`BeamBaseRadiusUnreal`, fed as `LensRadius`) is
>   the resolved lens radius, floored to `RebusBeamLensRadiusFloorCm` (**3 cm**) so the shaft begins
>   as a visible disc of the lens diameter, not a point; the mesh base ring and the material radial
>   profile agree on it at `axial=0`.
> - **Brighter defaults** — `RebusMeshBeamMaxIntensity` 3 → **4** and `RebusBeamDensity` 0.0025 →
>   **0.015**.
>
> **Tune live (MID scalar params, no re-bake):** `BeamDensity` (overall thickness/visibility, higher
> = denser), `BeamIntensity` (additive brightness; also driven by dimmer × `SetFixtureBeamVolumetrics`),
> `BeamFalloff` (source→tip dimming strength; lower = more even along length), `BeamSharpness` (radial
> edge softness).

> **Capped (closed) beam cone (v1.0.41).** `UpdateBeamConeGeometry` now adds a **base cap** (disc at
> the lens, `x=0`) and a **far cap** (disc at the throw, `x=L`) as triangle fans to axis-centre
> vertices, so the procedural cone is a fully closed volume. This resolves the v1.0.39 down-axis edge
> case: looking straight down the cone's axis previously hit no lateral wall → no fragment → the
> shaft thinned to nothing; the caps now provide a fragment along the axis, so the raymarch sees a
> surface and the full column inscatters (a bright disc/column instead of nothing). The raymarch is
> unchanged (C++ geometry only, **no re-bake**): a cap fragment behaves exactly like the side wall —
> EXIT = its own surface depth (clamped by scene depth), ENTRY = camera when inside else the analytic
> front intersection — so a near cap self-cancels and the far cap carries the column (**no
> double-add**). The material stays two-sided so caps render from both sides; cap normals are unused
> (unlit additive). The v1.0.40 distance falloff already dims the far end, so the far cap reads as the
> natural end of the column rather than a hard bright disc. Bounds are unchanged (cap centres lie on
> the axis within the existing ring extents).

> **DMX-fixtures-style beam + IES-driven light (v1.0.42).** Researched UE's native **DMX Fixtures**
> plugin (`Engine/Plugins/VirtualProduction/DMX/DMXFixtures`, `ADMXFixtureActor`): its visible beam
> is a **translucent cone static mesh raymarched** by `M_LightBeam` (params `DMX Quality Level` step
> size, `DMX Max Light Distance`, `DMX Max Light Intensity`, `DMX Lens Radius`), the lens is an
> **emissive disc**, and the cast light is a `USpotLightComponent` whose intensity is normalized by
> the cone solid angle and shaped by a **light-function cookie** — stock DMX does *not* read `.ies`.
> Our `ARebusFixtureActor` already matches this architecture (SpotLight + cone-mesh raymarch beam
> `M_RebusBeam` + emissive lens `M_RebusLensFlare`) **and exceeds it**: the SpotLight is driven by a
> true **runtime IES profile** built from the raw `.ies` text (`RegisterFixtureIes` →
> `RebusIes::BuildLightProfile` via the engine `IESFile`/`FIESConverter` module → `UTextureLightProfile`
> → `SpotLight->SetIESTexture`, `bUseIESBrightness=false` so the portal keeps brightness authority),
> with cone half-angle and candela intensity from the parsed photometrics. So no architectural
> "restart" was required; instead the beam **look** was matched to the DMX beam:
> - **Smooth Gaussian cross-section** (`core = exp(-rN²·BeamSharpness)`) replaces the old
>   `pow(1-rN)` hard rim — a soft glow with no crisp mesh edge.
> - **Soft depth fade** (`DEPTH_FADE_CM` = 50 cm) dissolves the shaft where it meets opaque geometry

### `RenderQuality` scene property (runtime tiers)

Push `SetSceneProperty name="RenderQuality" value="<tier>"` (case-insensitive; unknown values
fall back to `live`). Each tier re-applies **only** the MegaLights volume grid + sample count via
a console override (and re-asserts `Allow`/`Volume`); it does **not** touch `r.VolumetricFog.*`:

| Tier | `NumSamplesPerPixel` | `Volume.GridPixelSize` | `Volume.GridSizeZ` | Use |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **`live`** *(default)* | 2 | 8 | 64 | lightest — live previs streaming |
| `previs` | 4 | 4 | 128 | the "start here" baseline |
| `final` | 8 | 2 | 192 | heavy — final renders |

`live` is the **runtime default**: it is seeded in `URebusSceneSettingsSubsystem::Initialize`
(overriding the MegaLights volume `[SystemSettings]` baseline for the live stream) and stored in
`SceneState`, so the portal's control hydrates to `live` and every tier switch is logged. All
tiers also re-assert `r.MegaLights.Allow=1` + `r.MegaLights.Volume=1`. The `r.VolumetricFog.*`
froxel grid is untouched by tier switches and remains at the fixed defaults above.

### Volumetric fog + per-fixture beam scattering defaults

The **ExponentialHeightFog** component is configured for haze/beam visibility, both at authoring
time (`build_rebus_base_level.py`) and defensively on fresh spawn (`EnsureSceneEnvironment`):

- `bEnableVolumetricFog = true` (`SetVolumetricFog`)
- `VolumetricFogDistance = 35000` cm (`SetVolumetricFogDistance`)
- `VolumetricFogExtinctionScale = 0.3` (`SetVolumetricFogExtinctionScale`)
- `VolumetricFogScatteringDistribution = 0.4` (`SetVolumetricFogScatteringDistribution`)

Existing fog density/colour scene properties (`FogDensity`, `InscatteringColor`,
`bVolumetricFog`, `VolumetricScatteringDistribution`, `VolumetricExtinctionScale`, ...) still
drive the same component and can override these at runtime.

Each per-fixture `USpotLightComponent` (`BuildSpotLight`) gets:

- `VolumetricScatteringIntensity = 0` while the **hybrid cone-mesh beam** is on (the default,
  §8.4a) — the mesh shaft is the visible beam, so this light's fog scattering is suppressed to
  avoid a competing noisy froxel beam. The fog value (2.5) is restored if `bMeshBeams` is toggled
  off. **Exception (Phase 2)**: a hero shadow-casting beam re-enables a modest scattering (1.5) +
  `Cast Volumetric Shadow` so the native VSM fog carves light-blocking truss gaps (§8.4a).
- `bAllowMegaLights = true` — opts the light into MegaLights (5.7's per-light flag; defaults
  true, asserted so the project-level `r.MegaLights.Allow` governs the whole rig).
- **Hero-beam volumetric-shadow cap**: `SetCastVolumetricShadow(true)` for only the **first 8**
  spotlights created per spawn batch (`RebusMaxVolumetricShadowBeams`); the rest still scatter
  but skip the volumetric shadow pass. The session subsystem resets the budget
  (`ARebusFixtureActor::ResetVolumetricShadowBudget`) before every (re)spawn, so each fresh
  scene gets its own 8 hero beams. (With the mesh beam on, scattering is 0 so the hero-beam
  volumetric-shadow pass is effectively idle; it applies to the fog beam when `bMeshBeams` is off.)
- `SetFixtureBeamVolumetrics` (`ApplyBeamVolumetrics`) is **re-pointed (§8.4a)**: it now tunes the
  **mesh beam** intensity (a multiplier on `BeamIntensity`) rather than the fog scattering. The
  same value is stored so a `bMeshBeams=false` toggle restores an equivalent fog beam; the
  `castVolumetricShadow` flag (Phase 2) opts the fixture into the **native VSM fog volumetric-shadow
  hybrid** for light-blocking truss gaps, gated by a hero budget (`RebusMaxShadowFogBeams = 6`).

> **Caveat:** UE 5.7 MegaLights + volumetric fog can show artefacts with some sky / height-fog
> and GPU/driver combinations (flicker, sample noise, banding in the fog volume). The tiers
> exist to dial cost vs quality — drop to `live` if the live stream shows noise, raise to
> `final` for clean stills.

### Moving-head parity: the `profile` + `meshes` the portal must push

The plugin already parses and drives the full GDTF rig — to make the **physical heads move**
(not just the beam), the portal must include each fixture's **`motionRig`** *and* its
**`meshes`** in the push. Field names below are exactly what `RebusJson::ParseFixtureProfile`
/ `ParseMeshBundle` read; unknown fields are ignored, missing optionals stay unset.

**Coordinate conventions (do not mix these up):**
- `scene.fixtures[].matrixZUpMeters` — **RH Z-up metres**, column-major (or row-major when
  `matrixSource == "transform-row"`). This is the only Z-up payload.
- `motionRig` pivots/axes/`pivotOffset`, mesh `vertices`, and beam vectors /
  `worldMatrixMeters` — **RH Y-up metres**. (Most common mistake: the rig vectors are Y-up.)

```

**Axis identity field names:** each axis's identity/parent link is read from **either**
`nodeName`/`parentNodeName` **or** `geometryName`/`parentGeometryName` (the portal sends the
latter). The explicit `nodeName`/`parentNodeName` win when both are present. These names are
matched (`parentGeometryName` → `geometryName`) to resolve the parent-first axis order and the
tilt-under-pan compensation, so the head's tilt chains under the pan. `affectedGeometryNames`
remains the separate mesh→axis link field (unchanged).

**The linking rule that makes geometry move:** a mesh is bucketed onto a motion axis when its
`geometryName` *or* `modelName` (compared case-insensitively) appears in that axis's
`affectedGeometryNames`. The **deepest** matching axis wins; a mesh that matches nothing stays
on the static base; the beam/head tracks the deepest axis automatically. So the portal must
keep `affectedGeometryNames` consistent with the mesh `geometryName`s it pushes — otherwise the
geometry parents to the base and won't move even though the beam does.

> Watch message size: a full mesh bundle can be large. For big fixtures push each profile (with
> its meshes) via `RegisterFixtureProfile` first, then a final `LoadScene` carrying just `scene`.

## Compile-time touch-points to verify (Pixel Streaming 2)

PS2's C++ surface shifted across 5.5→5.7 and was not compiler-checked on the authoring
machine (no local UE). If the module fails to compile, these are the only spots to adjust —
all isolated to `RebusDataChannel.cpp` + the `Build.cs` module list:

- **Module names** in `RebusVisualiser.Build.cs`: `PixelStreaming2`, `PixelStreaming2Core`,
  `PixelStreaming2Input`. Some 5.7 layouts fold Core/Input differently.
- **Streamer discovery**: `IPixelStreaming2Module::Get()` / `IsAvailable()`,
  `FindStreamer(Id)`, `GetDefaultStreamerID()`.
- **Input handler**: `IPixelStreaming2Streamer::GetInputHandler()` (assumed `TWeakPtr` →
  `.Pin()`), `IPixelStreaming2InputHandler::RegisterMessageHandler("UIInteraction", Fn)` with
  `Fn = TFunction<void(FString SourceId, FMemoryReader)>`.
- **Send**: `IPixelStreaming2Streamer::SendAllPlayerMessage(TEXT("Response"), Json)` — the PS2
  frontend delivers `Response`-typed messages to the portal's response listener.

## Known best-effort areas

- **Runtime IES** (`RebusIes.cpp`) uses `FIESConverter` (Engine `IESConverter.h`). With editor
  data it uses the `Source` path; cooked builds fill platform data directly. If a shipping
  build can't load IES at runtime, pre-bake the profiles or fall back to the synthesized cone
  (already the default when no IES exists).
- **Gobo projection** (`RebusFixtureActor::FetchAndAssignGobo`) decodes the wheel image to a
  `UTexture2D` and feeds a light-function MID; the actual light-function material
  (`M_RebusGobo` with a `GoboTexture` param + *Volumetric Fog Uses Light Function Atlas*) is a
  content asset to author. Without it, gobo fetch is a no-op (lights still work).
- **Spotlight source size (§8.3)** (`RebusFixtureActor::BuildSpotLight`) sizes the
  `USpotLightComponent` emitter so the **beam starts at the lens diameter** (a finite disc, not a
  point) — the beam and its volumetric scattering emanate from the lens and gain soft-shadow
  penumbrae. `SourceRadius` (UE cm) is resolved by this precedence, the same diameter source order
  as the lens-flare disc but converted to a **radius**: `photometrics.lensDiameter / 2` (the IES
  lens opening) → `source.radiusMeters` → `source.diameterMeters / 2` → **leave the engine default
  untouched** (never fabricated). `SourceLength = 0` whenever a radius is set (circular GDTF beam,
  no second axis). The resolved radius is cached and reused as the base for the frost penumbra
  scaling, so the beam-origin diameter stays consistent with the lens-flare disc.
- **Emissive lens-flare disc (§8.3a)** (`RebusFixtureActor::BuildLensDisc`) spawns a thin
  `/Engine/BasicShapes/Plane` at the **`<Beam>` node origin**, parented under `FixtureRoot` and
  composed with the head motion (`LensDiscRest * Head`) so it tracks pan/tilt and stays
  perpendicular to the v1.0.21 beam direction (plane normal along the beam aim). Its **diameter
  source order** is `photometrics.lensDiameter` (metres, v6) → `source.radiusMeters * 2` →
  `source.diameterMeters` → a **synthetic dimensions fallback** (`0.4 × min(width, height)`,
  clamped 3–50 cm, so a disc + finite source always show when the portal sends no lens/source
  size) → skip only if even dimensions are absent. The plane (100 uu base) is scaled to
  `diameterCm / 100` and pushed slightly proud of the lens plane along the aim so head geometry
  can't clip it. The material is the committed **unlit, two-sided, ADDITIVE** master
  `/Game/REBUS/Materials/M_RebusLensFlare` (vector `EmissiveColor`, scalar `EmissiveStrength`,
  radial UV mask → round soft-edged glow). Additive (not translucent) means the disc **vanishes
  when the fixture is dark** instead of showing a black card. It is authored by the editor Python
  script `build_rebus_base_level.py` and the baked `.uasset` is committed. **Cook-safety:** the
  material is loaded by path (not referenced by any map), so the actor **hard-refs the mesh +
  material from its CDO** *and* `Config/DefaultGame.ini` lists `/Game/REBUS` + `/Engine/BasicShapes`
  under `DirectoriesToAlwaysCook` — otherwise the cooker strips the material and the disc never
  appears in `-game`/packaged builds. A per-fixture `UMaterialInstanceDynamic` is driven from the
  **live output** on the **same path that updates the SpotLight** (`RefreshIntensity` →
  `RefreshLensDisc`): `EmissiveColor` = the current linear fixture colour, `EmissiveStrength ∝
  dimmer × shutter-gate` (bright at full output, dark when fully dimmed, strobes in lockstep). It
  is purely **additive** — it never reshapes the SpotLight/IES beam. `BuildLensDisc` logs a single
  consolidated diagnostics line (`lens disc: SPAWNED ... meshOk/matOk ... relScale ... SourceRadius`)
  so a missing asset or zero scale is provable from logs.
- **Hybrid cone-mesh volumetric beam (§8.4a)** (`RebusFixtureActor::BuildBeamCone`) adds a visible
  volumetric **shaft** rendered as a procedural mesh — *alongside* (not replacing) the
  `USpotLightComponent`, which keeps surface lighting + IES + soft shadows. This gives an
  accurate, **IES-sized beam without the froxel-fog noise**.
  - **Geometry**: a **truncated cone (frustum)** built with `UProceduralMeshComponent` —
    **base radius** = the lens radius (`ResolveLensDiameterMeters()/2`, the same value driving
    `SourceRadius`/the lens disc, so the shaft starts exactly at the lens), **far radius** =
    `Length × tan(fieldHalfAngle)` where `fieldHalfAngle` is the current outer/field cone
    half-angle (`ResolveOuterHalfDeg`, shared with the SpotLight cone; zoom-range-clamped, iris-
    pinched), **length** = the SpotLight `AttenuationRadius` (the throw). Open sides, no caps,
    outward-radial smooth normals, collision **off**, `CastShadow(false)`. It is parented under
    `FixtureRoot` and composed with the head motion (`BeamConeRest × Head`, mesh `+Z` → beam
    forward) so it tracks pan/tilt and matches the v1.0.21 beam direction. The frustum is
    **regenerated on zoom/iris** (`RecomputeConeAngles → UpdateBeamConeGeometry`, gated to skip
    rebuilds when the far radius is ~unchanged).
  - **Material** (`/Game/REBUS/Materials/M_RebusBeam`, authored in `build_rebus_base_level.py`,
    baked + committed, CDO hard-ref + `/Game/REBUS` cook dir for cook-safety): an **unlit,
    two-sided, ADDITIVE** shader whose body is a **true N-step view-ray raymarch** in a single
    Custom HLSL node (Phase 2, v1.0.33). For each pixel it marches `StepCount` (~32) samples along
    the view ray from the cone's front face downrange, accumulating **front-to-back with
    transmittance** (`trans *= 1 − (1 − exp(−d·dt))`, energy-conserving) a density
    `d = BeamDensity × core × lenA`, where `core = pow(saturate(1 − radial/radiusAt), BeamSharpness)`
    is the **on-axis radial profile** (bright core → soft edge, `radiusAt` interpolated lens→far so
    it matches the mesh) and `lenA = pow(saturate(1 − axial/Length), BeamFalloff)` is the **length
    attenuation**. Output is `float4(BeamColor × BeamIntensity × coverage, coverage)` → Emissive +
    Opacity. **Camera scene-depth occlusion** clips the march at the opaque scene (`SceneDepth`
    converted to a distance along the view ray via the front-face `PixelDepth`), so the shaft
    disappears behind geometry from the camera; a **near-face soft clip** (`PixelDepth` ramp) stops
    popping when flying through the cone. MID params: `BeamColor`, `BeamIntensity`, `BeamSharpness`,
    `BeamFalloff`, plus the raymarch params `StepCount` + `BeamDensity` and the geometry feeds
    `BeamOrigin`/`BeamDir` (world, pushed each `RefreshMotion` so the marched cone matches the mesh
    after pan/tilt), `BeamLength`, `LensRadius`, `FarRadius`. *The Custom HLSL compiles cleanly in
    the headless bake (validated — `Success - 0 error(s), 0 warning(s)`).*
  - **Driven live**: `SetFixtureColor` → `BeamColor`; `RefreshIntensity` (dimmer × shutter-gate)
    → `BeamIntensity` (× `SetFixtureBeamVolumetrics` multiplier), so the shaft fades to nothing
    when dimmed/closed and strobes in lockstep; zoom/iris → frustum + half-angle; pan/tilt → head
    parenting. Initialised from current state at spawn.
  - **Coexistence + toggle**: while the mesh beam is on, the SpotLight's fog
    `VolumetricScatteringIntensity` is **forced to 0** by default (no competing noisy froxel beam).
    The `SetSceneProperty` boolean **`bMeshBeams`** (default `true`,
    `RebusSceneSettingsSubsystem::SetMeshBeamsEnabled`) toggles every fixture's cone on/off and,
    when off, **restores** the SpotLight fog scattering (the old fog beam) for runtime A/B. The
    lens-flare disc sits at the cone base (unchanged). `BuildBeamCone` logs a consolidated line
    (`beam: SPAWNED matOk ... baseRadius/farRadius/length/halfAngle ... BeamIntensity ...
    meshBeams=... coneFwd/spotFwd`).
  - **Direction = the live spotlight emission (ground truth, v1.0.34)**: the cone mesh and the
    raymarch are no longer oriented from a *constructed* rest basis (which could still render the
    shaft 180° opposite the real emission). Each `RefreshMotion`, `DriveBeamConeFromSpotLight`
    reads the **live `USpotLightComponent` world transform** *after* the spotlight is positioned —
    `GetForwardVector()` (the `+X` axis that actually lights the floor) and `GetComponentLocation()`
    (the lit origin) — orients the cone so its `+X` (frustum opening) **is** that vector, and feeds
    the same vector to the material `BeamOrigin`/`BeamDir`. So the spotlight forward, the cone mesh
    forward and the material `BeamDir` are provably the **same** vector. `RefreshBeamSpatialParams`
    emits a throttled proof line per aim change: `beam align: spotFwd=… coneFwd=… beamDir=…
    dot(spot,cone)=… dot(spot,beamDir)=…` (both dots must read `~1.000`, never `-1`).
  - **Light-blocking volumetric shadows (Phase 2, the must-have) — native VSM fog hybrid**: the
    trusses/set are **runtime-imported via glTFRuntime**, which has **no distance-field import
    option** (`FglTFRuntimeStaticMeshConfig` has no `bGenerateDistanceField`; mesh distance fields
    are an editor/DDC build step), so those meshes are **absent from the Global Distance Field** and
    a material can't `DistanceToNearestSurface`-trace them — and a material also can't sample a
    specific light's shadow map. The technique that **actually** carves a truss gap on runtime
    geometry is therefore **Virtual Shadow Maps**, which render *all* geometry regardless of
    distance fields. So a fixture that requests volumetric shadows
    (`SetFixtureBeamVolumetrics(castVolumetricShadow=true)`) and wins a **hero budget** slot
    (`RebusMaxShadowFogBeams = 6` per spawn batch, reset with the v1.0.19 cap) gets a **modest
    SpotLight `VolumetricScatteringIntensity` (1.5) + `Cast Volumetric Shadow`** re-enabled
    (`RefreshBeamShadowMode`): the native fog volume then shows the **real light-blocking truss
    gaps**, while the **mesh cone provides the crisp shaft**. All other beams stay mesh-only
    (scattering 0). **Trade-off / limit**: the shadow gaps come from the (slightly noisier, froxel)
    fog volume, not the crisp mesh cone, and only the few hero beams pay the cost; a per-fixture
    `USceneCaptureComponent2D` depth-shadow was rejected as higher-risk to validate headlessly.
    Gated by `bWantsVolumetricShadow` + the hero budget; `ApplyBeamVolumetrics` logs
    `wantsShadow/shadowHero/heroBudget`.
  - **A fixture does NOT self-shadow its own beam (v1.0.36)**: with the hero fog re-enabled, a
    fixture's OWN body geometry sits right at the light source and was carving mottled gaps into the
    base of its own beam (made worse by the v1.0.35 bound Orbit model stacking on top — two
    near-source occluders). Patchiness therefore tracked the hero/shadow-casting beams, not the
    mesh-only ones. Fix: `DisableSelfBeamVolumetricShadow` clears `bCastDynamicShadow` (keeping
    `CastShadow` for contact/RT grounding) on **both** the control-channel body `MeshComponents` (on
    `BuildMeshes`) **and** the matched/bound Orbit model components (on `BindOrbitComponents`). A
    movable spotlight's volumetric fog is shadowed by its VSM/shadow depth, which only includes
    `CastShadow && bCastDynamicShadow` primitives — UE5.7 has **no** per-primitive volumetric-fog
    flag (`bCastVolumetricShadow`/`SetCastVolumetricShadow` are **light-only**), so the dynamic-shadow
    opt-out is the lever. **Trade-off**: the fixture body no longer casts a dynamic shadow into ANY
    beam (incl. neighbours) or onto the floor — acceptable since fixture bodies are small/airborne.
    The trusses/set are OTHER actors and keep their dynamic shadows, so the wanted truss
    self-shadowing (the whole point of the hybrid) is **unaffected**.
- **Mesh→axis bucketing** matches GDTF `affectedGeometryNames`; opaque MVR proxy names
  (`mvr-glb-<uuid>`) that match nothing fall to the static base. The guide's height-plane
  split (§7.6) is the more robust fallback to add if needed.
- **Volumetric beams under MegaLights** (§5.7) — beams scatter through the level's volumetric
  height fog with MegaLights + its lighting volume (`r.MegaLights.Volume=1`) enabled. See the
  `RenderQuality` tiers and the artefact caveat above if the fog volume shows noise/banding.

## Orbit-imported model binding (Phase 1 A/B sync test)

The OrbitConnector import brings in the **light-fixture models** alongside the trusses/set. Those
models share the **same object id** as the fixtures delivered over the control channel, so we can
drive the imported model with the **same motion solve** as its `ARebusFixtureActor` and confirm
they move in sync. This is **Phase 1**: an overlay/A-B test — the control-channel mesh proxies stay
visible and authoritative; the Orbit overlay is **off by default** and toggled live. (Phase 2 —
dropping the control-channel `RegisterFixtureMeshes` import in favour of the Orbit models — is **not
done** here.)

- **Identification / matching (by object id).** On import, every Orbit static-mesh component is
  tagged (`UActorComponent::ComponentTags`) with the **names of its glb-node ancestry** — the
  Speckle object id is expected to be one of those node names. `URebusFixtureControlSubsystem::`
  `RebindOrbitModels` finds the import actor **generically by class name** (`"OrbitImportRoot"`, so
  RebusVisualiser keeps **no compile/link dependency** on the separately-owned OrbitConnector
  plugin), groups the tagged components into an `objectId → components` index, and binds each group
  to the registered fixture whose **`FixtureId` (Speckle node id)** equals that object id.
- **How the model is driven.** `ARebusFixtureActor::BindOrbitComponents` caches each component's
  imported (rest) world transform and the **head world transform at the rest pose** (`pan=tilt=0`),
  precomputing `OrbitBindBase = CompRestWorld · HeadWorldRest⁻¹`. Each `RefreshMotion`,
  `DriveOrbitModel(HeadLocal)` sets every bound component's world transform to
  `OrbitBindBase · (HeadLocal · ActorWorld)` — i.e. it applies **only the head's delta from rest**
  using the *same* `Cumulative[HeadAxisIndex]` solve that moves the control-channel head meshes, so
  the overlay tracks pan/tilt identically. No-rig fixtures drive with an identity head (the control
  meshes don't move either, so they stay in lock-step). The control-channel meshes are **not
  hidden** — both render together for the comparison.
- **Toggle (live).** Off by default. Enable either way:
  - **Scene property:** `SetSceneProperty name="bDriveOrbitModels" value=true|false` (round-trips in
    `SceneState`, re-asserted on respawn via `ReapplyAll`).
  - **Console:** `Rebus.DriveOrbitModels 1` / `Rebus.DriveOrbitModels 0`.
  Disabling restores every bound model to its imported pose.
- **Late binding (both orders).** Binding runs on a **1 Hz retry** (`URebusVisualiserSubsystem::
  Tick` → `RebindOrbitModels`, only while driving is enabled) plus on toggle and on (re)spawn. So a
  fixture that spawns **after** the import binds on the next pass, an import that arrives **after**
  the fixtures binds on the next tick, and a **re-import** (which destroys the components — held as
  weak pointers) rebinds when the live binding goes stale. Re-binding an already-bound id is skipped
  so the rest pose is never re-captured mid-motion.
- **Diagnostics to watch.** `Orbit bind: roots=… taggedComps=… distinctObjectIds=… | fixtures
  matched=… unmatched=… unmatchedFixtureIds=…` (match summary, throttled to changes);
  `Fixture <id>: BOUND <n> Orbit-imported component(s) by objectId '<id>'`; and per-update
  `Fixture <id>: drove Orbit model '<id>' pan=… tilt=… headRot=(P=… Y=… R=…) comps=…` (throttled to
  pan/tilt changes) so the overlay motion can be diffed against the control meshes.
- **Caveats / assumptions for the portal/import team to confirm.**
  - **The Orbit object id == the fixture `FixtureId`** (Speckle node id). Matching is exact-string
    against the glb node-name ancestry; if the portal exports the model under a *different* id (e.g.
    a Speckle *application* id or a decorated name), the `unmatchedFixtureIds` log will show it and a
    normalisation step is needed.
  - **Object-id tagging lives in OrbitConnector.** The import must tag each imported mesh component
    with its glb node-name ancestry (as this build does locally) for matching to work. That change
    is **not committed here** (OrbitConnector is owned by `orbit-connectors`); it must be upstreamed.
    Until then, a clean checkout binds **0** models (logged) and the overlay is simply inert.
  - **Whole-model overlay.** Phase 1 drives the *entire* matched model with the head solve (it can't
    tell yoke from base from generic tags), which is correct for pure pan/tilt sync but would also
    rotate a static base; per-part (head-only) driving is a Phase-2 refinement.

## Acceptance mapping (§12)

Fixtures spawn from `/scene` at placement · all `SetFixture*` keyed by node id, last-writer-
wins, optional `fadeMs` ease · selection highlight via custom-depth stencil (needs an outline
post-process material in content) · pan keeps base static (parent-first compose +
tilt-under-pan) · zoom reshapes cone + zoom-keyed IES with portal brightness authority ·
source radius → soft penumbrae · scene/quality applies, unknown names ignored · `Ready` →
`RequestSceneState` → `SceneState` read-back · streamer id from `-PixelStreamingID`.
